        <h3>Payment Obligations, Renewals, and Cancellations</h3>
        1. Website Development Payment Obligations: A down payment is required
        to begin the development of your website. This is usually 50% of the
        upfront design fee unless an alternative contract or proposal specifies
        a different amount. The outstanding balance on your website is due after
        the design, navigation, and pages have been approved and built. Final
        payment is due regardless of whether all content for the pages has been
        sent by the client. This provision is in place to encourage the client
        to get content submitted promptly so that their site can go live. It
        also ensures that we get paid for performing our duty under the
        proposal, despite tardy content from the client. After payment, Wind
        Websites will still post outstanding content AT NO CHARGE for 3 months.
        In the event an “under construction” page is posted due to missing
        content, Wind Websites will post ONE copy of any text/pictures on
        existing pages only, for up to 3 months after publish date. After the
        three months have expired, content posted to the site will be billable
        at our current regular hourly rate. If design and navigation changes are
        requested by the client after they have been specifically approved by
        the client, these changes will be billable at our current regular hourly
        rate. <br />
        2. Website Development Cancellation: If site design and development work
        has already begun (such as creating a design concept), then the down
        payment is non-refundable. Wind Websites may elect at our sole
        discretion to offer a partial refund depending upon the circumstances.
        Stock Photography Payment Obligations:
        <br />
        3. Stock photography includes most photos and/or images not provided by
        the client. Stock photography purchased on behalf of a client for use in
        website development is billable. This amount is separate from the amount
        quoted for website design and development. Some pictures are more
        expensive than others, in which case Wind Websites will solicit client
        approval and communicate the cost to purchase photos before purchasing.
        <br />
        4.Description of Ongoing Costs: There are 2 types of ongoing costs:
        domain registration/renewal and hosting. Domain name
        registration/renewal: This cost recurs annually. Domain name
        registration gives you exclusive rights to a certain name, such as
        www.mygroup.org, so that you can use it for your web-based purposes. You
        are NOT required to register a domain through Wind Websites, but we
        strongly PREFER that you do. Many services are not honest in the way
        they sell names and we spend a lot of time helping people re-secure
        rights to the name they thought they had already purchased. If you have
        registered your own name, make sure you have yourself as the Registrant
        and Administrative Contact with a current, easily accessible email
        address. This will help to ensure that your domain can be renewed or
        transferred should the need arise. Domain name registration fees are not
        refundable. Hosting: This cost recurs annually. Hosting places the
        website on a server connected to the web, which allows you to post a
        website for viewing through a browser. You are NOT required to host
        through Wind Websites, but we strongly PREFER that you do. Hosting comes
        with domain-based emails, bandwidth, storage space, database and
        security tools, and other features. Projects that involve custom
        programming must be hosted with Wind Websites to ensure the programs
        that we write will work. If you want to host your site on another server
        this must be disclosed before we begin programming. Hosting Renewal
        Payment Obligations: Your hosting account will be automatically renewed
        unless you give written notice to Wind Websites fifteen (15) days before
        the renewal date that you do not wish to renew the account. Hosting
        Cancellation Payment Obligations: You may cancel at any time. If you
        cancel before the first 30 days from the opening of your account, please
        refer to the details under “Limited 30-day Money Back Guarantee.” If you
        cancel after the first 30 days, you will be obligated to pay all fees
        and charges accrued prior to the effective date of the cancellation.
        Wind Websites will refund the prepaid fees for basic hosting for the
        full months remaining after the effective date of the cancellation, less
        any prior fees and charges, and an early cancellation fee of $25.
        Accounts that are terminated by Wind Websites for abuse or violations of
        internet standards or these terms and conditions will not receive any
        refund. All cancellations must be received in writing according to the
        deadlines indicated: regular mail and e-mail are acceptable. Phone
        requests will not constitute acceptance of any cancellation. Refunds
        will be issued back to you within 10 business days from your
        cancellation date. Hosting Transfer Payment Obligations: If you wish to
        transfer your hosting to another provider we can, upon request, assist
        with this. There may be charges related to any transfer that cannot be
        easily facilitated by providing cpanel access and/or ftp access. Limited
        30-day Money Back Guarantee on Hosting: If you are not completely
        satisfied with our services within the first 30 days from the opening of
        the account, you will be given a refund on your hosting fee excluding
        setup fees and time accrued from the setup date. If paid by credit card,
        refunds will be issued to the original credit card provided at the time
        of purchase. If your account has been canceled by Wind Websites due to a
        breach of the terms and conditions on your part, you will not be
        eligible for a refund. Domain name registration is non-refundable. Sites
        NOT Hosted by Wind Websites: Should the client decide to host their site
        on another server, We cannot guarantee that all elements of the site
        will work. We will make a reasonable effort to research the problem on
        the foreign platform to let the client know what we think the problem
        is. However, we cannot take responsibility for problems caused by or on
        another hosting server, including but not limited to email, FTP, SSL,
        database, server software, and site security issues. If we believe it
        will take a significant amount of time to fix the problem, we will
        advise the client before proceeding. In most cases, fixing problems on a
        foreign hosting server is billable.
        <br />
        5. Website Maintenance: There are no required maintenance fees other
        than domain registration and hosting. Most people do some work on their
        site every year, for which we offer several plans. We can make certain
        parts of the site updatable by you by implementing a custom Content
        Management System. For work we do on the site after going live, we
        charge on an hourly basis. If you expect that maintenance will be a
        regular occurrence, you can buy a prepaid maintenance contract that
        affords a discounted hourly rate. If need be, we can customize a
        maintenance plan for your needs, but no plan is required. <br />
        6. Website Maintenance Payment Obligations: Depending upon the nature of
        the website changes, a prepayment may be required. Should the client be
        invoiced after the changes are completed, the invoice is due upon
        receipt. If payment is not received within 30 days, the maintenance
        changes may be taken down until payment is received. After 60 days,
        there may also be a reposting fee added to the outstanding maintenance
        invoice balance.
        <br />
        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        1. Homepage Design – Once the site design is approved by the client,
        usually via email consent, the design is considered ready for
        implementation. Should the client wish to make changes to a design they
        have approved, those changes are billable at our standard hourly rate.{" "}
        <br />
        2. Navigation – Once site outline/map is approved by the client, usually
        via email consent, the site navigation is considered ready for
        implementation. Combined with the approved graphic design, this becomes
        the site structure. Once we build this structure per client approval,
        any subsequent changes are billable at our standard hourly rate. <br />
        3. Content – Provision of content is customer’s responsibility, unless
        specifically negotiated ahead of time as part of the project proposal.
        Text content – Copy for all website pages and links needs to be
        delivered digitally and should be carefully proof-read by the client.
        Two rounds of revisions will be provided free of charge. Subsequent
        revisions will be billable at our regular hourly rate. Copy
        development – Should client wish Wind Websites to develop content for
        the site, website copy is billable at our regular hourly rate.
        Development of copy is accomplished via our Web Development interviewing
        the client about the topic areas to be addressed on their web pages. We
        then composes appropriate copy, submits to the client for review, edit,
        and approval. Approved copy is then posted to the web pages. Graphical
        content – Images outside of the website design must be provided in
        digital form or in a form that can be easily scanned unless otherwise
        provided for in customer’s contract. Subsequent revisions will be
        billable at our regular hourly rate.
        <br />
        4. Database Implementation – Entry of data for database applications is
        considered client’s responsibility. Entry of data by us is billable,
        unless otherwise provided for in customer’s contract. <br />
        5. Email – Wind Websites offer free domain-based email accounts to our
        clients as part of any hosting contract. If the site is not hosted by
        Wind Websites, we take no responsibility for setting up and
        troubleshooting email problems. <br />
        6. Training – For websites with administrative control panels or content
        management systems, a one-hour Basic Training (Editor Access) will be
        provided. Additional training and/or Advanced Training can be scheduled
        at an additional fee.
        <br />
        7. Technical Support – We offer local and long-distance phone support to
        our clients. <br />
        <h3>Training and Tutorials</h3>
        Because customer service is an integral part of our business strategy,
        our projects include a one-time complimentary training session in order
        for our clients to better make use of their new web technology.
        Additional training hours can be purchased at our standard hourly rate
        or applied against your existing maintenance contract.{" "}
        <h3>Domain Transfers and DNS Management</h3> For domains not originally
        registered with Wind Websites, there will be a fee to either transfer
        the domain into our registration platform, or to transfer out to another
        registrar. If your domain is not registered with Wind Websites, DNS
        management and troubleshooting tasks are billable at our hourly rate.
        <h3>Websites with Proprietary Source Code</h3> Should client contract
        with Wind Websites to write custom code for a website application, this
        code is not transferable to a new developer or host. Custom written
        source code is considered the property of Wind Websites and cannot be
        shared with other developers. Clients are granted a license to use
        custom software code while on Wind Websites servers only. Wind Websites
        retains ownership of the code. In some cases, Wind Websites will install
        software for the client’s use that has been built by a third party.
        Examples include WordPress software, FCK editor software, shopping
        carts, photo galleries, etc. In these instances, clients will be subject
        to the terms and conditions of the third party who owns the software and
        may use the software as a licensee only. No ownership rights of any kind
        are transferred to the client. Access to or transfer of proprietary
        source code could result in a security risk to Wind Websites and its
        clients who are running similar pieces of code. In order to provide
        custom software development services, clients give Wind Websites access
        to private and/or sensitive information, trade secrets, proprietary
        pricing, and business methods. If clients believed that we may be
        sharing this information with outside developers, they could lose faith
        that we are protecting their proprietary information. Therefore, neither
        access nor transfer of any code built for any purpose that is unique and
        not commonly and publicly available can be granted. Should the client
        want Wind Websites to build software to run on another server, it must
        be disclosed upfront and specifically contracted for. Website components
        that are transferable to another host include HTML code, graphics,
        logos, pictures, navigation, text, and the data residing within a
        database (but not the code). Hourly fees will apply for any special work
        that needs to be done to transfer those parts of the website that do not
        violate the other paragraphs in this section.
        <h3>Non-Domain-Based Troubleshooting</h3> Wind Websites maintains and
        troubleshoots the websites we develop for our clients, as well as any
        domain-based email accounts of those websites. Wind Websites do NOT
        assume responsibility for upkeep or provide non-billable troubleshooting
        on our clients’ ISPs (Internet Service Providers), ISP-based email
        accounts (name@charter.net, name@3rivers.net, etc), your home or office
        internet connections, or any other non-domain-based issues outside Wind
        Websites’s realm of service. The provision of non-domain-based
        troubleshooting services will be billable at our normal hourly rate.
